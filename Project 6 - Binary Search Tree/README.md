# Project 6: Binary Search Tree
The purpose of this assignment is to assess your ability to:

* Implement a binary search tree structure
* Demonstrate tree traversals
* Analyze and compare algorithms for efficiency using Big-O notation

For this assignment, you will implement a binary search tree and use it to store a large text file. Your program should read text from a file and insert each word in a binary search tree. Do not store duplicate text.

Once the tree is populated, print the contents of the tree using an in-order traversal. Next, allow the user to enter words to search for. For each word entered, your program should report the number of elements inspected and whether or not the word was located. Next, allow the user to enter words to remove from the tree. After each removal, print the contents of the tree.

The SinglyLinkedList class is defined by the following data:
* A node pointer to the front and the tail of the list

# Time complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree for all functions!

Write a thorough test program for this class.
