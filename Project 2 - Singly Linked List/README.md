# Project 2: Singly-Linked List
The purpose of this assignment is to assess your ability to:

* Implement sequential search algorithms for linked list structures
* Implement sequential abstract data types using linked data
* Analyze and compare algorithms for efficiency using Big-O notation
For this assignment, you will implement a singly-linked node class. Use your singly-linked node to implement a singly-linked list class that maintains its elements in ascending order.  

The SinglyLinkedList class is defined by the following data:
* A node pointer to the front and the tail of the list

## Implement the following methods in your class:
|  Requirement                          | Implementation |
| -------------                         | ------------- |
| A default constructor 			          | **list<T> myList**  |
| A copy constructor                    | **list<T> myList(aList)**  |            
| Access to first element		            | **myList.front()**|
| Access to last element			          | **myList.back()**|
| Insert value 				                  | **myList.insert(val)**|
| Remove value at front			            | **myList.pop_front()**|
| Remove value at tail			            | **myList.pop_back()**|
| Determine if empty			              | **myList.empty()**|
| Return # of elements			            | **myList.size()**|
| Reverse order of elements in list	    | **myList.reverse()**|
| Merge with another ordered list	      | **myList.merge(aList)**|

Write a thorough test program for this class.
