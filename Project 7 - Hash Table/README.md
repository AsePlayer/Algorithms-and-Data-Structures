For this assignment, you will implement a hash table and use it to store words in a large text file. Your hash table should use chaining for collision resolution. You may design any hash function you wish.

Your program will read a file and insert each word into a hash table. Once the table is populated, allow the user to enter words to search for. For each word entered, your program should report the number of elements inspected and whether or not the word was located.
